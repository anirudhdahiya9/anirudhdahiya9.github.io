I'm Anirudh Dahiya, an MS by Research student in *Computational Linguistics* at [Language Technologies Research Center](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in). 

I'm interested in developing AI for generalizable language computation, and am currently researching about the same in Code-Mixed Languages. I'm also interested in the current state of research in automatic summarization, question answering, discourse parsing and their adaptations in low resource domains.

I was previously a Research Intern at [Naver Labs Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/), Grenoble, France and Advanced Data Reseach Management Group, Siemens RnD Bangalore, India
